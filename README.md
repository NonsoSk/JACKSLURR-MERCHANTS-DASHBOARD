# JACKSLURR-MERCHANTS-DASHBOARD
This power Bi project shows analysis of sales, employees, customers and shipping and how all of these have affected employee-customer relationship.

## Overview
This data analysis project aims at exploring the relationship between employees and their customers while examining properly the sales trend, sales performance of products, the company`s return (Revenue and profit) as well as their services rendered through deliveries and shipping of these products. The JACKSLURR traders analysis is a power BI based project through which we will gain insights that shall cover extensively four areas:

1) Sales
2) Employee performance
3) Customer information
4) Shipping
   
To properly do this, we will perform data cleaning, and appropriate use of power query editor. We shall explore data analysis functions (DAX) to get our KPIs and other definitive analysis to help us gain more insights.

Introduction
By analyzing the datasets related to the Jackslurr traders which covers information of their sales, products, customers, workers and shipping, we shall answer the following basic questions:

## SALES

- What are the top 5 countries by revenue?
- Show the trend of profit made over the years
- What category of products generate the highest revenue, and what product sell the most?
- Show the amount generated from sales in each month
- Which countries contribute more to the revenue of the company

## EMPLOYEES

- Find out the best employees as well as the worst
- Show how each employee delivered products ordered; find out if they delivered effectively or didn’t deliver at all.

## CUSTOMERS

- Which customers were given the highest discount over the years and show the corresponding quantity of products they bought?
- How many customers didn’t get their ordered products delivered to them and how many times.
- Top 3 customers who have made the highest orders
- Top 3 customers who have generated the highest revenue for the company
- Who stands as the best customer for 2015?

## SHIPPING
- What shipping company render the best delivery service?
- Show the quantity of goods shipped by each shipping company
- What is the best delivery day?
- What country has spent more in shipping her product?

However, in the course of this analysis, I was able to ask deeper questions outside the questions above, the aim was to get detailed insights without losing sight of our primary questions.

My goal is that by the completion of this project, we must have had a detailed understanding of the jackslurr traders employee`s behavior in relation to their customers, the overall shipping service as well and how this has affected the sales of the company. The result of our analysis could help the company know the customers to focus on, what category of products to enhance, what shipping company to prioritize, what employee to promote and those to encourage and then how best to optimize the general service it renders.
The project could also provide valuable insights for entrepreneurs, business organizations, and managers to devise strategies for sustainable business management and enhance worker-customer relationship.
